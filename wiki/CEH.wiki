- mySQL default port 5432

- Fumbling is the term for systematically failing to access a resource.

- capinfos is a Wireshark command line tool that reads a capture and returns statistics on that file.

- Rainbow tables are precomputed hashes that are intended to contain every possible combination of characters for the purpose of comparing them against a captured password.

- The Forwardedevents log is the log class that stores events from remote hosts.
- Using a harmless executable file to hide malware is known as using wrappers.

- The rolling buffer is a memory location where data is cyclically dumped.

- HTTP Header --> Referer is the header that includes the URL of the web page containing the link that initiated the current request.

- 128 is the Time-to-Live (TTL) value in Windows.


Windows

Install the Xming software.
If you have not already done so, download putty.exe from the PuTTY site and install it.
Run Xming on your PC to start the X server.  You should see the Xming icon in the taskbar if it is running (although you may have to click the little arrow in the taskbar to see it)
Run PuTTY and set things up as follows:

- Enter the server name in Host Name
- Make sure the Connection type is set to SSH
- Enable X11 forwarding (Connection > SSH > X11)

Log in using your normal IU username and passphrase
Once you are logged into the linux system, you can just run the GUI program of your choice (ie. matlab, mathematics, etc) and it will display on your PC.


Hash Examples
Likely just use hash-identifier for this but here are some example hashes:

Unix = MD5 hash
Kali = SHA512 hash
Windows XP = LM Hash
Windows 7 = NTLM Hash

-a 0
0 = Straight
1 = Combination
2 = Toggle case
3 = Brute Force

-m 0 (Each number is a different Hash Type)
0 = MD5 hash…. so we use -m 0
50 = HMAC-MD5….so we use -m 50
1000 = NTLM….so we use -m 1000

hashcat -m 0 -a 0 /root/hashes/hashes.txt /root/rockyou.txt

hashcat -m 0 -a 1 /root/hashes/hashes.txt /root/rockyou.txt
(to launch a combination against MD5 password hashes)

Rockyou contains 14 million unique records.

For MD5 and SHA1 hashes, there is a 190GB, 15-billion-entry lookup table, and for other hashes, they offer a 19GB 1.5-billion-entry lookup table.
